"""
object oriented programming is a way to breakdown a complex problem in managable parts.

for example i need to make resturant of robots
robots needed : Manger, waiter, cashier, cook, cleaner (Objects)

each of these robot will have two properties: (for example: waiter- object
1. Have - is_holding_plate = True, table_responsible = [1,2,4,5]-------Have = attributes
2. Doing - Def takeOrder(table,order), Def take_payment(amount)--------Doing = methods

Blueprint of generating objects(like waiter, cook etc) is called Class
